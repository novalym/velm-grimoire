# Ω | VELM GRIMOIRE
### The Celestial Archive of Gnostic Archetypes

> "Existence is form; Action is will. The Grimoire is the bridge where Thought becomes Matter."

The **Velm Grimoire** is a sovereign, self-indexing repository of `.scaffold` archetypes. It serves as the "App Store for Architecture" for the VELM God-Engine, enabling the instantaneous streaming and materialization of production-grade software structures.

## 🏛️ Repository Topology

This repository is designed for **Zero-Maintenance Ascension**. It is a living organ that scries its own contents to maintain a global index.

*   **`archetypes/`**: The Inner Sanctum. Contains all `.scaffold` scriptures, organized by domain.
*   **`scripts/`**: The Kinetic Limbs. Houses the `rebuild_index.py` Librarian.
*   **`index.json`**: The Soul of the Grimoire. A machine-readable census of all manifest archetypes, auto-generated by GitHub Actions.
*   **`.github/workflows/`**: The Celestial Scribe. Orchestrates the automatic indexing and adjudication of every push.

## 📜 The Law of the Header (Mandatory)

For a shard to be recognized by the Librarian, it must bear the **Gnostic Header**. This scripture allows the `GnosticDNAOracle` to perceive the shard's nature without parsing its body.

Every `.scaffold` file **must** begin with:

```scaffold
# =================================================================================
# == GNOSTIC ARCHETYPE: [NAME] (V-Ω-TOTALITY)                                   ==
# =================================================================================
# @description: [A powerful, single-sentence summary of the intent.]
# @category: [Backend | Frontend | Infrastructure | Intelligence | System | Meta]
# @tags: [comma, separated, semantic, keywords]
# @difficulty: [Novice | Adept | Master | Grand Architect]
# @is_integration: [true | false]
# @dna: key=val, key2=val2  # Gnostic Overrides for the Engine
# =================================================================================

⚡ The Symphony of Ascension (Workflow)

As the High Architect, your workflow is distilled into a single, atomic act: The Push.

    Forge: Create or transfigure a .scaffold file in the archetypes/ folder.

    Inscribe: Ensure the Gnostic Header is pure and follows the law.

    Proclaim: Execute the strike from your terminal:
    code Bash

    git add .
    git commit -m "feat(shard): manifest [archetype-name]"
    git push

    Ascend: The Celestial Scribe (GitHub Action) awakens. It:

        Conducts a Gnostic Inquest (Linting headers).

        Summons the Librarian to rebuild the index.json.

        Inscribes the new index back to the repository.

        Broadcasting the new Gnosis to the Velm Dev Site and all CLI Nodes.

🤝 The Rite of Contribution

We welcome Acolytes who wish to enshrine their own patterns in the Grimoire.
I. The Vow of Purity

All contributions must result in "Titanium Stability" projects. If you provide a fastapi archetype, it must include Pydantic V2, Ruff configuration, and a multi-stage Dockerfile by default.
II. The Process

    Fork the Grimoire: Create a parallel reality of this repository.

    Manifest your Shard: Add your .scaffold file to the archetypes/ directory.

    Test the Gnosis: Run the Librarian locally to ensure your DNA is scryable:
    code Bash

    python scripts/rebuild_index.py --repo your-user/velm-grimoire --vault archetypes

    Submit a Pull Request: Offer your shard to the High Council for adjudication.

🛡️ Integrity & Security

Every shard in this Grimoire is stamped with a SHA-256 Merkle Fingerprint.

When the VELM Engine pulls an archetype from this archive, it compares the downloaded matter against the fingerprint in the index.json. If a mismatch is detected, a Heresy of Corruption is proclaimed, and the materialization is stayed.
